# elixir-training-ex1

This is Elixir Training first exercise. The goal is to understand basic Elixir
syntax and Phoenix framework design.

## The exercise

This exercise consists in uncommenting
`test/controllers/movie_controller_test.eex` test by test, implementing the
behavior described in each one.

To implement every test you will need to create
the needed controller, route, view and templates. Some of the needed files are
given to the student as a help (as the movies form, for example).

## Starting the application

To start your Phoenix app:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

## Testing

To test the app:

  * Execute all tests with `mix test`
  * Execute only one folder/file test with `mix test file_or_folder_name`
  * Execute only one test with `mix test --only line:42 file`
  * Watch for changes and auto execute tests changing `test` by `test.watch`.
